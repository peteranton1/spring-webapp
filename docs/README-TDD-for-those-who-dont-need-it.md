# Overview

Test Driven Development (TDD) is all the rage these days. 

## The TDD Benefits arguments

* Gives you confidence to Refactor
* Helps you write a better designed API
* Serves as documentation for the intended behaviour
* Untested code is legacy code

## The Anti-TDD counter-arguments

* I already have HUGE confidence
* My code is already well-designed. Unlike yours.
* My commit log is more awsome than your resume
* Untested tests are legacy code too

# What Matters Most

Say you are a professional developer. 
What are you thinking about?

* Requirements
* Machinery

| Thinking about | Which Means |
| ----------- | ---------------------- |
| Machinery | The technologies and approaches you use to mean the requirements. |
| Requirements | Hand-waving vagueness that is subject to change at the whim of the customer |
